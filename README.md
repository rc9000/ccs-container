# ccs-container
Cisco Config Search Appliance based on Apache Solr

## Overview
ccs-container is a ready-to-use appliance to index and search the configurations of a Cisco-based enterprise network. 
It comes with the following components:

 * fully configured Solr fulltext search engine with a an optimized schema for config files
 * a configuration parser to transform the config files from plain text into a hierarchical XML document
 * a simple web application to explore the indexed content
 * everything is neatly wrapped up in a Docker image
 
 This is currently a work in progress, check back later for instructions etc.
